Source code of my Thesis: The Design and Implementation of an Intelligent Tutoring System with Mathematical Induction

This program works to introduce students to various levels of Mathematical Induction. Here is how it works:

1. The tutoring system will ask the student's desired starting level (Advanced has not yet been implemented)
2. The system will then enter the tutoring session with the student. It will go through a problem and ask questions to guide the student to a correct answer.
3. After solving the problem, it will evaluate the students progress and either retain,demote, or promote the student.
4. The process from step 2 then repeats until the program is quit.

The only file that needs to be run is ITJPrototype.java.

To allow for the graphical interface, you will need the Processing 3 library, which is here in core.jar. Be sure to add it as a library.

When starting the program, select a difficulty. Then, to advance through the dialogue, click and the tutoring system will display the next line of the chat, next picture, or ask a question.
When asked a question, hover over the dropdown menu then click on an answer and the tutoring system will respond accordingly.
