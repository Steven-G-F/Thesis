Let's try a slightly different math induction problem. 
While this is an inequality now, the same steps will apply to this problem.
$2
As always, the first step is to prove the base case is true. 
$2
What will the base case be for this problem??
$1
n=1
n=0
n=-1
NEXT
$2
$3
We are proving this for all positive integers.
The first positive integer is 1, thus it is our base case.
While n=0 and n=1 are often the base case, don't forget that the base case depends on the problem given.
NEXT
$6
You have the right idea. However, 0 is not a positive integer.
There will be cases where n=0 will be the bases case, so it is important to always read the parameters.
Try thinking in terms of the first positive integer.
Let's give this another go.
For this problem, what will the base case be?
$7
NEXT
$5
Close, but -1 is not in our domain, which in this case, is all positive integers.
Let's try that again.
$7
NEXT
$2
In the next step, let's solve for both sides. 
What does the inequality look like when testing the base case?
$1
2^(1)>1
2^(n)>n
2^(k+1)>k+1
NEXT
$2
$3
NEXT
$5
This is restating the original equation.
We are trying to prove the base case using the number we found.
Try filling in the blank again.
$7
NEXT
$5
You are thinking ahead, which is good.
However, before we move onto the inductive step, we must first prove the base case.
Without that, there will be no domino effect. 
Try that again.
$7
NEXT
As we can see, 2>1, so the base case is proven by math induction.
This proves the base case.
Now that the base case is solved, we move onto the assumption step.
What should we assume?
$1
Assume n=k, where k is a positive integer
Assume n=k+1, where k is a positive integer
Assume n=k-1, where k is a positive integer
NEXT
$2
$3
We assume the statement is true for n=k, where k is a positive integer.
From here we can continue the proof in terms of k.
NEXT
$6
We will get to this step eventually, but you are thinking ahead.
We need to first establish k as a variable for the proof.
Try again.
$7
NEXT
$5
We already proved the base case was correct. 
Now we need to prove this for all other positive integers.
Try again.
$7
NEXT
Now, with this assumption in mind, what do we now need to prove?
$1
2^(k+1)>k+1
2^(k)>k+1
2^(k+1)=k+1
NEXT
$2
$4
We fill in k+1 to prove the next case from "some integer" k
NEXT
$6 
Remember, we are proving the next case for both sides.
Give it another go!
$7
NEXT
$5
Don't forget, this is an inequality.
Try that again.
$7
NEXT
Unlike equations, inequalities are solved a bit differently.
We need to rewrite the left-hand side to prove the inductive hypothesis.
$2
How can we rewrite this accordingly?
$1
2*2^k
4^k
2^k+2
NEXT
$2
$3
NEXT
$5
We can't combine terms in this way.
However, using rules of exponents, we can split it up.
We want to use the rule a^(b+c)=a^b*a^c
Give that another go.
$7
NEXT
$5
While the exponent has a sum, that does not directly transfer since we are working with exponents.
We want to use the rule a^(b+c)=a^b*a^c
Try filling in the blank with this given information.
$7
NEXT
Now we can use our induction step with thee right-hand side.
How can we rewrite it?
Using our assumption. Please fill in the blank:
$1
2k
2+2k
2
NEXT
$2
$3
We are using the inductive hypothesis, so it is, in a way, restating what we are trying to prove.
Since we assume 2^k>k, then 2(2^k)>2(k) is also true.
NEXT
$6
We are using our assumption in order to prove this case correct.
That is, 2^k>k.
Please try that again.
$7
NEXT
$5
Rememeber, we are using the inductive hypothesis. 
That is, 2^k>k.
Give it another go!
$7
NEXT
Now, since we know k represents all positive integers, how can we prove the inductive step true?
$1
Combine all three terms into one inequality
Divide both sides by 2
Now prove the right-hand side
NEXT
$4
$2
NEXT
$5
That would get us back to the first step.
Try using the fact we are working with inequalities to our advantage.
NEXT
$5
Unlike equations, we aren't trying to make both sides equal.
Try using the fact we are working with inequalities to our advantage.
$7
NEXT
We have all the components necessary to state that this case is true for all positive integers.
As you can see, the inequality is true.
Thus, we have proven 2^(k+1)>k+1
Unlike previous examples, the simplification was less algebraic and utilized properties of inequalities.
This may seem complicated, but practicing a few examples will help you understand them more easily.
Our last step is our conclusion.
After a few practice examples, we know the two components we need 
They are the base case and satisfaction of inductive hypothesis.
And that is it! I hope you found this guided session helpful.
