We will begin with this math induction example. 
Here is the problem, where we must prove the statement true for all positive integers n.
$2
As we know, the first step is to prove the base case. 
$2
What will the base case be for this problem??
$1
n=1
n=0
n=-1
NEXT
$2
$3
We are proving this for all positive integers.
The first positive integer is 1, thus it is our base case.
NEXT
$6
You have the right idea. However, 0 is not a positive integer.
There will be cases where n=0 will be the bases case, so it is important to always read the parameters.
Try thinking in terms of the first positive integer.
Let's give this another go.
For this problem, what will the base case be?
$7
NEXT
$5
Close, but -1 is not in our domain, which in this case, is all positive integers.
Let's try that again.
$7
NEXT
$2
In the next step, let's solve for both sides. 
What do we get for the LHS of the equation?
$1
2(1)-1=1
2-1=1
2(2)-1=3
NEXT
$2
$3
NEXT
$5
Rememeber, we are using the above equation.
Try filling in the blank again.
$7
NEXT
$5
Rememeber, we are using the above equation.
Try filling in the blank again.
$7
NEXT
This is what it is when plugged into the left-hand side of the equation.
Now how about the other side?
Fill in the blank.
$1
(1)^2=1
2(1)-1=1
1=1
NEXT
$2
$3
NEXT
$6
This statement is not clearly from the above equation.
Tr to utilize the given equation to solve this problem.
Give it another go!
$7
NEXT
$5
This is the previous answer, the left-hand side
We are trying to now prove the right-hand side.
Give it another go!
$7
NEXT
After solving LHS and RHS, we can see both sides are equal (1=1)
This proves the base case.
Now that the base case is solved, we move onto the assumption step.
What should we assume?
$1
Assume n=k, where k is a positive integer
Assume n=k+1, where k is a positive integer
Assume n=k-1, where k is a positive integer
NEXT
$2
$3
We assume the statement is true for n=k, where k is a positive integer.
From here we can continue the proof in terms of k.
NEXT
$6
We will get to this step eventually, but you are thinking ahead.
We need to first establish k as a variable for the proof.
Try again.
$7
NEXT
$5
We already proved the base case was correct. 
Now we need to prove this for all other positive integers.
Try again.
$7
NEXT
Now, with this assumption in mind, what do we now need to prove?
$1
n=k+1
n=k-1
n=k
NEXT
$2
$4
We want to prove this for n=k+1 since we already proved this case for n=1.
Therefore, if we prove this statement, then we prove that it is true for all integers after 1.
That is, n=1+1, n=2+1, and so on until reaching n=k+1, whatever positive integer k may be.
NEXT
$6 
This is the right idea, but is actually the opposite direction we want to go.
We are trying to prove this for all positive integers, so subtracting 1 would be contradictory to our end goal.
With that additional information, what should we aim to prove?
$7
NEXT
$5
This is what we already assumed, so solving for this case does not move the proof forward.
This is known as an inductive hypothesis, as shown.
With that additional information, what should we aim to prove?
$7
NEXT
$2
Now, what will the left-hand side of the equestion look like given what we are trying to prove?
$1
1+3+5+...(2k-1)+[2(k+1)-1]
1+3+5+...+k+(k+1)+(k+2)
1+2+3+...+k
NEXT
$2
$3
NEXT
$5
Yes, we are planning to use k+1
However, we want to us the original equation in the proof to prove this.
Try filling in the blank once more.
$7
NEXT
$5
This does not use the equation we are aiming to prove.
This may be confusing as this was the correct solution in one of the previous problems.
However, try to use the given equation, as a quick substitution will solve the problem.
Try filling in the blank with this given information.
$7
NEXT
Our goal, now, is to prove both sides are equal. 
We will go over the simplification steps together, but I do recommend trying it out yourself.
$2
Using our assumption. Please fill in the blank:
$1
k^2
(k+1)^2
2k-1
k
NEXT
$2
$3
We are using the inductive hypothesis, so it is, in a way, restating what we are trying to prove.
From here we don't have to worry about the series with an undefined length.
We can see this substitution using with the identical parts indicated in red.
NEXT
$6
We are using our assumption in order to prove this case correct.
Please try that again.
$7
NEXT
$5
Rememeber, we are using the inductive hypothesis. 
This is information that has already been given to us.
Give it another go!
$7
NEXT
$5
We want to use the above equation, the inductive hypothesis.
Try once more.
$7
NEXT
$2
After simplifying the left hand side, what should we get?
$1
2k+1
2k+2
2k
NEXT
$4
$2
We use the distributive property to simplify this equation.
NEXT
$6
Try using the distributive property: a(b+c)=ab+bc
Don't forget to distribut both numbers before subtracting the 1.
Try filling in the blank again.
$7
NEXT
$6
Try using the distributive property: a(b+c)=ab+bc
Don't forget to distribut both numbers before subtracting the 1.
Try once more.
$7
NEXT
Alright, we are almost finished with the simplification!
$2
Using factoring, what will our final equation look like?
$1
(k+1)^2=(k+1)^2
k^2+1=k^2+1
k^2=k^2
NEXT
$3
$2
The left-hand side is a perfect square, thus we can use that to easily simplify the equation.
NEXT
$5
This may look a bit complicated, but it uses an algebraic factoring rule that can be completed in one step.
We can complete the square on the left-hand side.
Try that again, you got this!

$7
NEXT
And that is it for simplification! 
Looking at both sides of the equation, we can see they are equal.
Thus, we have proven the statement is true for n=k+1 is true for n=k+1.
$2
Our last step is our conclusion.
What two pieces of evidence do we have that can prove this statement true?
$1
Base case and satisfaction of inductive hypothesis.
Base case and substitution of k+1
Satisfaction of inductive hypothesis and substitution.
NEXT
$2
$4
With this, we have proven this statement true for all positive integers.

To prove any math induction problem, we need to satisfy the domino effect.
What pieces will allow us to put that into place?
