We will begin with a simple math induction example. 
Here is the problem, where we must prove the statement true for all positive integers n.
What is the first step in any math induction problem?
$1
Solve the base case
Solve for both sides
Try a few test cases to prove its validity
NEXT
$2
$3
This is the first step in any math induction problem. 
This is where we build up the "domino effect."
NEXT
$5
The left side of the equation has no definite length.
This is because we are proving this case for all positive integers n.
Therefore, we cannot simply solve the equation for both sides.
Let's try that again.
What is the first step in any math induction problem?
$7
NEXT
$5
This is a rational way to think, and is a good way to test that the statement is true.
However, testing certain cases is best for proving a statement incorrect by contradiction.
That will come at a later time, but for now we need to prove this for all positive integers.
Let's give that another go.
What is the first step in any math induction problem?
$7
NEXT
$2
Now then, for this problem, what will the base case be?
$1
n=1
n=0
Any positive integer
NEXT
$2
$3
We are proving this for all positive integers.
The first positive integer is 1, thus it is our base case.
NEXT
$6
You have the right idea. However, 0 is not a positive integer.
There will be cases where n=0 will be the bases case, so it is important to always read the parameters.
Try thinking in terms of the first positive integer.
Let's give this another go.
For this problem, what will the base case be?
$7
NEXT
$5
We are looking for a specific base case. 
This can also be seen as the first case, or the first instance of a case.
Using any positive integer may not include the scope of all positive integers.
Let's try again.
For this problem, what will the base case be?
$7
NEXT
$2
Which side of the equation does this part prove?
$1
LHS (left hand side)
RHS (right-hand side)
NEXT
$2
$3
NEXT
$5
Rememeber, we are using the above equation.
Which side does this represent?
$7
NEXT
This is what it is when plugged into the left-hand side of the equation.
Now how about this simplification?
$1
RHS (right-hand side)
LHS (left-hand side)
NEXT
$2
$3
NEXT
$5
Rememeber, we are using the above equation.
Which side does this represent?
$7
NEXT
With these two statements, what can we say the base case is proven as?
$1
true
false
NEXT
$2
$3
NEXT
$5
In math induction, the aim is to prove a statement true within a certain scope. 
And in this case, we have shown both sides are equal.
Therefore, we have proven the base case...
$7
NEXT
As shown, both sides are equal, thus proving the base case.
Now that the base case is solved, what is the next step?
$1
Assume n=k, where k is a positive integer
Assume n=2, testing the next case
Assume n=10, to test a large number
NEXT
$2
$3
We assume the statement is true for n=k, where k is a positive integer.
From here we can continue the proof in terms of k.
NEXT
$5
We already proved the base case was correct. 
Now we need to prove it for all other positive integers.
$7
NEXT
$5
We already proved the base case was correct. 
Now we need to prove it for all other positive integers.
$7
NEXT
With this assumption in mind, what do we now need to prove?
$1
n=k+1
n=k-1
n=k
NEXT
$2
$4
We want to prove this for n=k+1 since we already proved this case for n=1.
Therefore, if we prove this statement, then we prove that it is true for all integers after 1.
That is, n=1+1, n=2+1, and so on until reaching n=k+1, whatever positive integer k may be.
NEXT
$6 
This is the right idea, but is actually the opposite direction we want to go.
We are trying to prove this for all positive integers, so subtracting 1 would be contradictory to our end goal.
With that additional information, what should we aim to prove?
$7
NEXT
$5
This is what we already assumed, so solving for this case does not move the proof forward.
This is known as an inductive hypothesis, as shown.
With that additional information, what should we aim to prove?
$7
NEXT
$2
Now, what will the left-hand side of the equestion look like given what we are trying to prove?
$1
1+2+3+...+k+(k+1)
1+2+3+...+k
1+2+3+k+k+1
NEXT
$2
$3
NEXT
$5
This is the statement we already assumed to be true. 
We need to prove it one step further now.
Try filling in the blank once more.
$7
NEXT
$5
For now, we don't have a definite length when it comes to the LHS.
We will aim to rememedy this, but for now, use what we are trying to prove.
Try filling in the blank with this given information.
$7
NEXT
Our goal, now, is to prove both sides are equal. 
We will go over the simplification steps together, but I do recommend trying it out yourself.
$2
Using our assumption. Please fill in the blank:
$1
k(k+1)/2
(k+1)/2
k(k+1)+k
2*(k+1)
NEXT
$2
$3
We are using the inductive hypothesis, so it is, in a way, restating what we are trying to prove.
From here we don't have to worry about the series with an undefined length.
We can see this substitution using with the identical parts indicated in red.
NEXT
$6
Rememeber, we are using the inductive hypothesis. 
This is information that has already been given to us.
Please try that again.
$7
NEXT
$5
Rememeber, we are using the inductive hypothesis. 
This is information that has already been given to us.
Give it another go!
$7
NEXT
$6
Rememeber, we are using the inductive hypothesis. 
This is information that has already been given to us.
Try once more.
$7
NEXT
$2
For the next step, what should fill in the blank?
$1
2(k+1)/2
(k+1)/2
2(k+1)/4
NEXT
$4
$2
Using lowest common denominator, we can simplify the fraction.
NEXT
$6
We need to use the lowest common denominator in order to simplify this. 
We need an equivalent statement.
Try filling in the blank again.
$7
NEXT
$6
You are correct in that we need to multiply the numerator by 2.
However, 4 is not the correct denominator.
Try once more.
$7
NEXT
Alright, we are almost finished with the simplification!
We can now combine the numerators into one fraction since they have the same denominator.
Using factoring, what will our combined numerator be?
$1
(k+2)(k+1)
(2k+1)(2k+2)
(k+2)(2k+1)
NEXT
$3
$2
We factor using the rule a(c+d)+b(c+d)=(a+b)(c+d) to get our solution.
NEXT
$5
This may look a bit complicated, but it uses an algebraic factoring rule that can be completed in one step.
There is no need to distribute the 2, which is what may have caused this confusion.
Try that again, you got this!

Try that again, you got this!
$7
NEXT
And that is it for simplification! 
Looking at both sides of the equation, we can see they are equal.
Thus, we have proven the statement is true for n=k+1 is true for n=k+1.
$2
Our last step is our conclusion.
What two pieces of evidence do we have that can prove this statement true?
$1
Base case and satisfaction of inductive hypothesis.
Base case and substitution of k+1
Satisfaction of inductive hypothesis and substitution.
NEXT
$2
$4
With this, we have proven this statement true for all positive integers.
NEXT
$5
To prove any math induction problem, we need to satisfy the domino effect.
What pieces will allow us to put that into place?
